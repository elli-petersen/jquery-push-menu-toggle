# Push Menu Toggle w/ localStorage
This is a standard push menu (or sidebar) with the addition of HTML5 localStorage, which will store the state of the menu. When the user refreshes the page, closes the browser window or tab, or starts a new session, the menu will maintain its open or closed position.

**NOTE:** If the user's browser is set to delete cookies when a session is closed, the menu state will not be maintained -- localStorage items are deleted along with cookies.
